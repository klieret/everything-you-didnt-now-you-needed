# Pre-commit hooks
Run small checks *before* you commit


* **Problem:** How can I stop myself from committing low-quality code?
* **Solution:** 
  * *git hooks* allow you to run scripts that are triggered by certain actions
  * a pre-commit hook is triggered every time you run `git commit`
    * in principle you can set them up yourself by placing scripts into `.git/hooks`

::right::

* **Making it practical:**
  * The [pre-commit framework](https://pre-commit.com/) is a python package that makes configuring pre-commit hooks easy!
  * All hooks are configured with a single `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file
  * Few-clicks GitHub integration availble: [pre-commit.ci](https://pre-commit.ci/) 



* **Setting it up:**
  1. `pip3 install pre-commit`
  2. `cd <your repo>`
  3. `touch .pre-commit-config.yaml`
  3. `pre-commit install`
  4. Profit 🎉
